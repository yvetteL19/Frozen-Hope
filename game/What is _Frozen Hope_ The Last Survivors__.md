# **What is "Frozen Hope: The Last Survivors"?**

### **What kind of game is this?**

Simply put, this is a **single-player "text adventure" story game.**

Imagine this: the plane you're on has crashed in the Himalayas. You are one of 6 survivors.

A blizzard is coming. You are trapped in the plane's wreckage with very limited food and medicine. You must find a way to survive and last until rescue arrives.

### **What do you do in the game?**

1\. Choose Your Character  
At the start, you pick one of 6 unique survivors to play as. For example:

* **The CEO:** A natural leader, but hiding a fatal secret.  
* **The Programmer:** Looks useless, but might be the only one who can fix the rescue beacon.  
* **The Assistant:** Seems like a "nobody," but is secretly the only one with medical training.  
* **The Guide:** The only "expert" on the wilderness, but he seems to have hit his head in the crash.  
* ...and other characters.

Whoever you pick, the other 5 become your **computer-controlled companions (NPCs).**

2\. Make Difficult Decisions  
The game will constantly present you with difficult problems to drive the story forward. Every decision is a matter of life and death.

* **For example:** You find one first-aid kit, enough for only one person. The Pilot (NPC) has a broken leg, but the CEO (NPC) also desperately needs the medicine. Who do you choose to save?  
* **For example:** The Guide (NPC) insists he knows a "safe cave" nearby and urges everyone to leave immediately. But the Pilot (NPC) warns that leaving the wreckage in a blizzard is suicide. **Who do you listen to?**

### **What's special about this game?**

The core of this game is about **"Cognitive Biases" (or "Mind Traps").**

What does that mean?

1\. Your companions will give you "bad advice"  
Your NPC companions aren't perfect. They get scared, they panic, and they can be selfish. They will give you a lot of advice that sounds logical but is actually dangerously wrong.

* *"This is how I survived last time\!"* (—but he forgot the other 9 people who tried it and died)  
* *"Don't touch that radio\! Every time you touch it, the storm gets worse\!"* (—even though it's just a coincidence)  
* *"We've had 3 straight days of bad luck. Our luck is bound to turn tomorrow\!"* (—that's just wishful thinking)

2\. It reveals why you chose wrong  
You will be under immense pressure, trying to figure out which advice is rational and which is a dangerous "mind trap."  
After you make a decision, the game will show you the result. If your choice was based on one of these "mind traps," a message will pop up and **tell you in simple terms:**

"You just fell for the 'Survivorship Bias' trap."  
"This means: You only listened to the one story from the Guide who 'survived,' and you didn't think about all the others who might have taken that same path and didn't survive."

### **Your Goal**

Your goal is simple: **Survive.**

You must manage your health, calm (or confront) your companions, distribute scarce resources, and try to make the "least bad" choice in a minefield of mental traps, all to hold out until rescue finally arrives.

This isn't just a survival game; it's a psychological experiment about human nature and why we make bad decisions under pressure.
